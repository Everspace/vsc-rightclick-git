## Features

It does this and not much else:

![Context Menu](images/Context-Menu.png)

I think that's pretty nifty though.

You can also find those options on the context menu of the editor title by right clicking the file tab.

## Requirements

- Git

## Known Issues

- Probably does not really handle some of the more esoteric
  setups involving things like git within git, remote git, or multiple folders although I tried.

## Release Notes

See the [Changelog file](CHANGELOG.md).

## License
