Stop having to go into the SCM tab for goodness sakes.

## Features

It does this and not much else:

![Context Menu](images/Context-Menu.png)

I think that's pretty nifty though.

## Requirements

* Git

## Known Issues

- Currently experincing a bug where the file must be "active" (open in an editor tab) for the context menu to work.
- Does not support "multiple selections" nor committing a whole subfolder.
